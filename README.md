# ðŸ“˜ Data Science Methodologies â€” CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD

This repository showcases three complete, end-to-end data science projects implemented using industry-standard methodologies:
- **CRISP-DM** (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
- **SEMMa** (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess)
- **KDD** (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)

Each project is stored in its own subdirectory with code, reports, datasets, and documentation.
